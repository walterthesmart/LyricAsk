### 🎶 LyricFlip Contribution Rules 🎸  

Hey there, music lover and coding wizard! 🎤 Ready to flip some lyrics and create magic? Before diving in, here are a few fun ground rules to keep things harmonious:  

IF AN ISSUE IS TAGGED FOR AN EVENT AND YOU APPLY FOR IT BEFORE THE EVENT, YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFIED FOR THAT ISSUE!!!

1. Be Respectful, Stay Cool 😎
   We’re all here to have fun and build something awesome. Treat everyone with respect, even if their code is offbeat.  

2. No Code Without Context 🚫✍️ 
   Every contribution should sing a story! Always include a clear description of your changes, why they’re needed, and any supporting notes.  

3. Test Before You Jam 🎧
   Whether it’s code or lyrics, nobody likes bugs. Test your changes thoroughly before opening a PR. It’s all about that smooth rhythm.  

4. Stick to the Playlist 📝
   Follow the project structure and coding conventions. You can check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for details. Think of it as staying on-key!  

5. Branch Out 🌿
   Create a new branch for your changes. Never push directly to `main`—we like to review tracks before they go live!  

6. Small Tweaks, Big Hits 🎯
   Small, focused changes are easier to review and merge. Avoid the temptation to remix the whole app in one PR.  

7. Sing Out for Help 🆘🎤
   Got a question? Need guidance? Drop your query in the Discussions or Issues tab, or hop into the Telegram channel. We’ve got your back!  

8. Celebrate Your Wins 🎉
   Whether it’s fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving docs, every contribution matters. Celebrate your effort—you rock!  

Now go ahead and make some noise! 🚀
